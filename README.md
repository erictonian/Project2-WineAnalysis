# UTA Data Bootcamp Project 2 - Analysis of Wine Ratings

Project Proposal:

- Dashboard style web app exploring wine review data

- Data needs:
  * Lat/Lon for each country
  * Pull year from 'title' column

- Main graphic: World Wine Map (WWM)
  * Geolocation query by country
  * Bubble for each country reflecting number of wines produced, other summary data
  
- Potential other graphics (off of user selection from WWM)
  * Interactive d3 like hw so user can compare different variables (price vs rating, region vs. rating, etc.)
  * Pie/bar breakdown of type of wine (cab sauv, red blend, etc.)
